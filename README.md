# Turbopack

Turbopack is a high-performance monorepo setup that streamlines the development, testing, and deployment of multiple interconnected projects. With a focus on speed, scalability, and developer experience, Turbopack leverages modern tooling and best practices to ensure your monorepo remains maintainable and efficient as it grows.

## Features

- **Fast Builds**: Leveraging incremental builds and intelligent caching.
- **Unified Dependencies**: Centralized dependency management to avoid version conflicts.
- **Consistent Tooling**: Shared configuration for linting, testing, and building.
- **Isolated Environments**: Sandbox environments for each project.
- **Easy Collaboration**: Simplified setup for new contributors.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle projects of any size.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (>=14.x)
- **Yarn** (>=1.22.x)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/turbopack.git
cd turbopack
yarn install
```

### Project Structure

```plaintext
turbopack
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ legacy       # Legacy code & servers
â”œâ”€â”€ nx-rspack    # Rspack monorepo using module federation of legacy UI and new UI
â”œâ”€â”€ devenv       # Scripts to run Docker images
â””â”€â”€ go-nx        # Go modules workspace for GraphQL API
```

    A[Turbopack] --> B[legacy];
    A --> C[nx-rspack];
    A --> D[devenv];
    A --> E[go-nx];
```

### Usage

Use `go-nx` commands to create libraries and applications within the project.

### Known Issues

- **Legacy Code**: Not working with Docker. Ensure Dockerfiles are agnostic and configurations are correct.
- **UI Module Federation**: Proper integration of legacy and new UI is required.
- **Golang Migration**: Migrate Golang code to the new base.
